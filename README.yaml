  Our project is a stock exchange simulater. Users are able to deposit funds 
  into their account and simulate buying and selling stocks. As the markets move, 
  their portfolio reflects the real time prices. This project is meant to give 
  people an oppertunity to get first hand investment experience, without any of 
  the risks involved. The user interacts with the stock simulater through a 
  Command Line Interface.
